List Comprehensions

Question: Write a Python list comprehension that generates a list of all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
Bonus: Modify the comprehension to include only those numbers where the sum of their digits is greater than 5.



Create a Python list containing the numbers 1 to 5. Write a script to print the list in reverse order.


Given a string s = "Hello, World!", write a Python script to convert the string to all lowercase letters and then print it.


Write a Python script that takes a user's age as input and prints whether they are a child (age < 18), an adult (18 ≤ age < 65), or a senior (age ≥ 65).


Write a Python loop that prints the numbers from 1 to 10, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
