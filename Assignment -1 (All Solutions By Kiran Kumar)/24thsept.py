# Question - 71 
# Write a program to calculate the electricity bill.According to the following criteria, for 1st 100 units there is no charge, For next 100 units there is â‚¹5 per unit, and after 200 units, the price is rupees 10 per unit. If the input is 350 then total bill amount is Rupees 2000.

# calculate electricity bill
# 0 to 100 Units = No Charge.
# 100 to 200 Units = 5 Rs Per Unit.
# 200 +  = 10 Rs Per Unit.

# demo example - Need to validate
# input is = 350 Unit
# Bill Amount = 2000 Rs 

# (Good Question to Practice) - A Practical example of if elif statements.

units = float(input("Enter Number of Units : "))
if 0 <= units < 100:

elif 100 <= units < 200:
    print(f"Total Bill = {(units-100)*5}")
elif units >= 200:
    print(f"Total Bill = {(100 * 5)+ ((units-200)*10)}  ")
    # unit = 250,   0 to 100 - no, 100 to 200 = 100*5 ,  200 to 250 = 50*10
