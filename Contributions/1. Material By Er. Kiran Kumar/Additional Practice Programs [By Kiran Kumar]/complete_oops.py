# Complete OOPs. 

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# Object Oriented Programming System /Strucutre  ---- It is a way of writing code! 
# It's a programming paradigm --- No one is forcing to write code in OOPs, you can write in procedural & functional as well, but it is not scalable. ....when you want to create scalable products, that time OOPs will help you a lot. 
# ML & AI -- end to end projects are made using Python, here we use OOPs concepts a lot. 

'''
1. Procedural/Functional Approach is not a lot helpful for real world case.

Prodcedural -- code in line by line  -- sum of two numbers.
Functional -- inside the functions -- code reuse.


Google, Amazon, Startup, Goldman ---- always working on their code ...constantly evolving --- if code has a good structure, then it is better.
# code that can be expanded.
# you can build upon the already written codes.

# millions of sellerr ---- it's not good to create that much variable or put in list....we need some template, which we can use it multiple times....based on the new sellers.

# It is always helpful if we could create a blueprint of what we want and then create multiple copies via it. 
# casting -- make product.   [inspired by the real life]

So, OOPs help us in doing below things...
1. Define our own data type.
2. Generality to Specificity.

OOPs is thus a programming paradigm, which help us to write better code.
